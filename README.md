# Spark 

Apache Spark is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.

  - The Hadoop Distributed File System(HDFS) is the primary data storage system used by Hadoop applications

The problem is to implement Spark on HDFS and slove the given Problem Statements using the given Data Set
  - The dataset consists of 37 columns and 2M Rows from which some of them are used for Solving the Problem
  - 5th column is Gender
  - 25th column is Salary
  - 26th column is Last % Hike
  - 30th column is Country
  - 31st column is City
  - 34th column is Region

 - I have Created a Task Class into which my all business logic are Present in file name task.py
 - And also a python file name context.py into which SparkContext and Data Reading from hdfs function resides into Context Class
 - And a runner.py file is there which is responsible for executing all the business logic
 - Command to execute runner.py is :-
```sh
$ python runner.py
```
Question 1 :- Count number of employees in each Region, Country and City.
Solution :- The solution for this Question is divided into three parts
 - 1st :- For Region
 - - I have created a function region in task.py file in Task Class
 - 2nd :- For Country
 - - I have created a function country in task.py file in Task Class
 - 3rd :- For City
 - - I have created a function city in task.py file in Task Class
